/**
 * Which settings the storefront may read without authenticating.

 * Before this existed, `GET /api/settings/:category` was public, took any key,
 * and returned the whole stored value. An anonymous request for `payment`,
 * `features` or `quick_commerce` returned everything an admin had saved there —
 * including anything secret.
 *
 * Two rules close that, and the second is the one that keeps it closed:
 *
 *   1. **Category allowlist.** A category not named here is not public at all.
 *      New categories are private by default, which is the safe direction.
 *
 *   2. **Booleans only, unless a field is explicitly named.** Feature flags and
 *      payment-method availability are booleans; API keys, secrets, webhook
 *      URLs and account identifiers are strings. Publishing only booleans means
 *      a credential added to one of these categories later cannot leak through
 *      this endpoint by omission — the failure mode is a missing toggle, not a
 *      disclosed secret.
 *
 * `general` is absent deliberately: it has its own public handler with a
 * hand-written field allowlist, because storefront identity is legitimately
 * made of strings.
